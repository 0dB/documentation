'''PureScript''' is a [[strict evaluation|strict]], [[purely functional|purely]] [[functional programming|functional]] [[programming language]] inspired by [[Haskell]] which [[Source-to-source compiler|compiles]] to readable [[JavaScript]] with a simple [[foreign function interface]] and no runtime dependency.
