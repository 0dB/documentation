# Type Classes

PureScript supports type classes via the `class` and `instance` keywords.

Types appearing in class instances are must be of the form `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, or `C t1 ... tn` where `C` is a type constructor (including `->` and `t_i` are types of the same form).

Type class instances are resolved based on the order in which they appeared in the source files. Overlapping instances will result in a compilation error.

Here is an example of the `Show` typeclass, with instances for `String`, `Boolean` and `Array`:

```purescript
class Show a where
  show :: a -> String

instance showString :: Show String where
  show s = s

instance showBoolean :: Show Boolean where
  show true = "true"
  show false = "false"

instance showArray :: (Show a) => Show (Array a) where
  show xs = "[" <> joinWith ", " (map show xs) <> "]"

example = show [true, false]
```

## Superclasses

Superclass implications can be indicated in a class declaration with a backwards fat arrow `<=`:

```purescript
class (Monad m) <= MonadFail m where
  fail :: forall a. String -> m a
```

This code example defines a `MonadFail` class with a `Monad` superclass: any type which defines an instance of `MonadFail` will be required to define an instance of `Monad` too.

Superclass instances will be used when searching for an instance of a subclass. For example, in the code below, the `Applicative` constraint introduced by the `pure` function can be discharged since `Applicative` is a superclass of `Monad`, which is in turn a superclass of `MonadFail`:

```purescript
assert :: forall m. (MonadFail m) => Boolean -> m Unit
assert true = pure unit
assert false = fail "Assertion failed"
```
