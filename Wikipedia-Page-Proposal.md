PureScript is a purely functional programming language which compiles to Javascript.

PureScript uses strict evaluation, and provides an expressive type system featuring a kind system, type classes, row polymorphism and rank-N types.

The first version of PureScript was released in September 2013 by Phil Freeman. As of January 2016, the project has over 60 contributors on GitHub. PureScript took part in the 2015 Google Summer of Code. 

[PureScript Conf 2015](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/wiki/PureScript-Conf-2015) was the first conference devoted to the PureScript language, with the [2016 edition](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/wiki/PureScript-Conf-2016) scheduled for May 2016. A [book](https://leanpub.com/purescript) on the language was released in 2015.

## Examples

### Hello World

```purescript
module Main where

import Control.Monad.Eff.Console (log)

main = log "Hello, World!"
```

## Features

### Type System

#### Algebraic Data Types

PureScript features _algebraic data types_, using a syntax similar to that of Haskell:

```purescript
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
```

#### Type Inference

PureScript types are _inferred_ by the compiler, based on the types of subexpressions. For example:

```purescript
map f Nil = Nil
map f (Cons x xs) = Cons (f x) (map f xs)
```

Here, the type of `f` does not need to be specified. PureScript will infer the correct type `forall a b. (a -> b) -> List a -> List b`.

The PureScript compiler provides warnings when type signatures are not provided on top-level declarations, encouraging users to provide types as a form of documentation.

#### Type Classes

PureScript supports type classes using a dictionary-passing transformation. 

For example, a type class for types with decidable equality is defined in the Prelude library:

```purescript
class Eq a where
  eq :: a -> a -> Bool
```

PureScript functions which are constrained by the `Eq` class are compiled to JavaScript functions, with an additional function argument which carries the `Eq` implementation as an object.

Type class instances are named in PureScript, using a double colon to separate an instance name from the instance head, as in a type declaration:

```purescript
instance eqList :: Eq a => Eq (List a) where
  eq Nil         Nil         = true
  eq (Cons x xs) (Cons y ys) = x == y && xs == ys
  eq _           _           = false
```

#### Extensible Records

PureScript represents records using Javascript objects at runtime, and implements _extensible records_ using row polymorphism.

For example, it is possible to write a PureScript function which extracts a `name` value from any record with a `name` property:

```purescript
getName rec = rec.name
```

PureScript will infer the following type for `getName`:

```purescript
getName :: forall r a. { name :: a | r } -> a
getName rec = rec.name
```

The type signature indicates that not only the type of the `name` field, but also the _remaining fields_ in the record, are left polymorphic.

Row polymorphism is also used to implement features such as record updates.

#### Extensible Effects

PureScript makes use of row polymorphism to implement its effect system. PureScript's core libraries define the `Eff` type constructor, which is used to represent effectful values. `Eff` is parameterized by a row of effect labels, and row polymorphism is used to combine computations which make use of different combinations of effects.

For example, the PureScript compiler is able to infer the most general type of the following computation which makes use of the `RANDOM` and `CONSOLE` effects, even if the type signature is omitted:

```purescript
printRandom :: forall eff. Eff ( random :: RANDOM
                               , console :: CONSOLE 
                               | eff
                               ) Unit
printRandom = do
  n <- random
  print n
```

Developers are able to define new effect types using the foreign function interface. It is possible to assert that a function only uses a specific set of effects by using a type signature.

### Generic Programming

PureScript supports generic programming using type classes and _generic deriving_. The `Generic` type class can be defined for data types using the `derive` keyword:

```purescript
newtype Person = Person
  { name :: String
  , location :: String
  }

derive instance genericPerson :: Generic Person
```

A `Generic` instance can be used to implement data-type generic functionality such as equality testing, comparison, pretty-printing, and JSON serialization and deserialization.

### Foreign Function Interface

PureScript is designed specifically with compilation to Javascript in mind, and its Javascript interoperability is cited as one of PureScript's design goals, and one of its strengths.

Javascript functions can be used from PureScript by assigning types in `foreign import` declarations:

```purescript
module FFI.Example where

foreign import shout :: String -> String
```

Every module has an optional companion CommonJS module which contains its foreign function implementations. For example, the function defined above might be defined in a CommonJS module as follows:

```javascript
// module FFI.Example

exports.shout = function(s) {
    return s + "!";
};
```

Conversely, PureScript functions and values can be used from Javascript, since PureScript compiles to CommonJS modules. Developers of new foreign types are expected to document the representation of those types in Javascript.
