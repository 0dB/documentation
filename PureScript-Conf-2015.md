PureScript Conf is a _free_, one-day conference concentrating on the PureScript language and its libraries.

## Where?

PureScript Conf will be colocated with [LambdaConf](http://degoesconsulting.com/lambdaconf-2015) in Boulder CO.

## When?

PureScript Conf will be held on Thursday, May 21st 2015, the day before [LambdaConf](http://degoesconsulting.com/lambdaconf-2015).

## Speakers/Schedule

### Crash Course in PureScript

**@puffnfresh**

**1 hour**

_Abstract_

An introduction to PureScript, describing the core principles and features:

* Algebraic data types
* Type-classes
* Rank-N types
* Records
* FFI
* Effects
* Tooling

An assumption is made that you're familiar with functional programming. A version of the presentation without that assumption will be given at [BoulderJS](http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-JS/) on the Wednesday 20th (the day before PureScript Conf).

### Principled, Painless Asynchronous Programming in PureScript

**@jdegoes**

**30 mins**

_Abstract_

Asynchronous programming in the browser or node.js is painful, and error-prone! Promises/A+ "promises" to make that better, but the complexity of the numerous ad hoc specifications ensure plenty of confusion, corner cases, and tangled, incomprehensible code. Fortunately, the PureScript language provides us everything we need to make asynchronous programming sound, comprehensible, type-safe, and easy! In this talk, John A. De Goes reviews the `purescript-aff` library and ecosystem, highlighting the power of the library, and showing that asynchronous programming can be just as easy &mdash; no, easier! &mdash; than synchronous programming. Only a basic knowledge of PureScript is assumed, so this talk can be considered a continuation of earlier presentations.

### Reactive UIs with Halogen

**@paf31**

**1 hour**

`purescript-halogen` is a new library for developing reactive front-end web applications in PureScript. I will give a brief overview of the ideas behind the library, and we will work through the creation of a simple application from scratch. Bring a laptop! 

### Purescript Deployment with Nix/NixOS

**@laneseppala**

**1 hour**

_Abstract_

### Call for Speakers

_Anyone_ who would like to present a topic related to PureScript development is more than welcome to do so. Any level of experience is appropriate, although we would like to encourage speakers to prepare something appropriate for a beginner-level audience. If you have a topic, please add the title and a brief description above.
