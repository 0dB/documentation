## Needs Documentation

Add topics you'd like documented, followed by specific questions about the topic.

- Newtype
-- Difference between keyword and type class.
-- Removed `runAdditive` in v0.10, moved to `wrap` from `Newtype` class. Why have `run*` in first place?

- Functional Dependencies
-- What type-checking errors does it resolve?
-- When should I use functional dependency in my type class?

- Typed-holes and type wildcards
-- Names are similar, needs clarification.

- Compile Iteration Techniques
-- Hole-driven development with typed-holes.
-- Faculties of editor plugins. Using pscid as editor-independent alternative.
-- Iterating module while testing in psci.
