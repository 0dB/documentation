PureScript Conf is a _free_, one-day conference concentrating on the PureScript language and its libraries.

## When and Where?

_Location TBD_

## Instructions for Attendees

- Install the PureScript compiler for your operating system (usually just `npm install -g pulp purescript`)
- Make sure `psc` and `pulp` are on your PATH and that you can use `pulp` to build an empty project.
