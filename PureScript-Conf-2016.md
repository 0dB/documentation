PureScript Conf is a _free_, one-day conference concentrating on the PureScript language and its libraries.

## When and Where?

PureScript Conf will be colocated with [LambdaConf 2016](http://lambdaconf.us). It will be held _before_ LambdaConf, on Wednesday 25th May.

_Location TBD_

## Instructions for Attendees

- Install the PureScript compiler for your operating system (usually just `npm install -g pulp purescript`)
- Make sure `psc` and `pulp` are on your PATH and that you can use `pulp` to build an empty project.

## Speakers/Schedule

### The State of PureScript (Discussion)

**@paf31**

**1 hour**

Let's discuss the interesting developments over the past year, the current state of PureScript, and plans for the future.

### How to Teach PureScript to JavaScript-ers

**@AppShipIt**

Adapting [Elm's pedagogical philosophy](https://youtu.be/oYk8CKH7OhE) to make PureScript less intimidating to newcomers by deferring potential sources of [_accidental_ complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) in an _essentially_ [simple](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md) language.

### Integrating Purescript into a legacy Javascript codebase

**@dkoontz**

What happens when the miraculous occurs, you get the go ahead to use Purescript in your production app? What doesn't happen is that you stop, rewrite everything in Purescript, and then start again. This talk will cover the challenges and solutions developed while introducing Purescript into an Electron powered desktop application.

### Call for Speakers

_Anyone_ who would like to present a topic related to PureScript development is more than welcome to do so. Any level of experience is appropriate, although we would like to encourage speakers to prepare something appropriate for a beginner-level audience. If you have a topic, please add the title and a brief description above.
