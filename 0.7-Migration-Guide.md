The 0.7 ("Meltdown") release contains some major changes to the compiler and core libraries, which will make most code break. This guide should help you to update your libraries.

## Build Process

- The `psc` executable has been replaced with `psc-make`, which has been renamed to `psc` (in an effort to standardize on CommonJS module output). Features which were previously only available in `psc` (dead code elimination, bundling code for the browser) are now handled by the new executable `psc-bundle`, which works with the output of `psc-make` (for faster, incremental builds).

## Numeric Literals

- There are now `Int` and `Number` literals. To disambiguate the two, integer `Number` values must now be written with a decimal place (`3.0` rather than `3`).

## Core Libraries

- The `Prelude` module is no longer imported automatically, and must be imported the same way as any other module.
- No modules are included with the compiler now, they have been broken out into their own libraries:
  - [purescript-prelude](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-prelude)
  - [purescript-eff](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-eff)
  - [purescript-st](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-st)
  - [purescript-console](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-console)
  - [purescript-functions](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-functions)
- Declaring operators in classes will now produce a warning. Changes will be coming to operators in PureScript 0.8, and moving to named members in classes with operators as aliases (e.g. `(<$>) = map`) should make the transition easier in the future.

## No more array sugar

- `[]` syntax for array types has been removed. It is still possible to use `[]` array literals however.
  - `[]` should now be written as `Array`, and `[a]` as `Array a`.
- Cons patterns for arrays have been removed.

## No more inline FFI code

- JavaScript for the FFI can no longer be provided inline.
  - Values must instead be provided in a separate `.js` file, and passed to the compiler with the `-ffi` flag.
  - Values should be provided in the form `exports.foo = ...`, similar to a CommonJS module
  - The file should have a comment `// module X.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` is the name of the module the JS values are for.
  - [See here for an example](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-eff/blob/v0.1.0-rc.1/src/Control/Monad/Eff.js)
