The 0.7 ("Meltdown") release contains some major changes to the compiler and core libraries, which will make most code break. This guide should help you to update your libraries.

## Build Process

The `psc` and `psc-make` executables have been replaced with `psc` (previously `psc-make`) and `psc-bundle`.

If you were previously using `gulp-purescript` or Pulp to build your library, you should be able to simply upgrade that tool to the latest version. An example `gulpfile.js` file can be found [here](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-prelude/blob/5e1d34f6ee771a436286a0335c5de80343dfa6be/gulpfile.js).

If you were building your library directly, you will need to learn the new `psc` options, and how to use `psc-bundle` if you are bundling your code for the browser.

Invoking `psc` directly is now much simpler, since `psc` now supports globs as filename arguments. Simply provide globs for all PureScript source files, and for all foreign modules with `--ffi`:

    psc 'src/**/*.purs' 
        'bower_components/purescript-*/src/**/*.purs'
        --ffi 'src/**/*.js' 
        --ffi 'bower_components/purescript-*/src/**/*.js'

## Numeric Literals

`Int` and `Number` literals are now separate, and disambiguated syntactially: `Number` values must now be written with a decimal place.

```purescript
1 :: Int
1.0 :: Number
```

You might see type errors like "Cannot unify `Int` with `Number`". Simply decide which of the two types is more appropriate in each case, and add or remove `.0` as necessary.

## Core Libraries

### Prelude Import

The `Prelude` module is no longer imported automatically, and must be imported the same way as any other module. Simply add

```purescript
import Prelude
```

to the top of your module.

### Prelude as a Library

The Prelude modules are no longer bundled with the compiler. You have to install the appropriate libraries using Bower (or some other tool):

- [purescript-prelude](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-prelude)
- [purescript-eff](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-eff)
- [purescript-st](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-st)
- [purescript-console](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-console)(Debug.Trace replacement) 
- [purescript-functions](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-functions)

You might see this error when loading PSCi:

    PSCi requires the `purescript-console` module to be installed.

To fix this, install `purescript-console` using Bower:

    bower i purescript-console

and load the installed modules using your `.psci` file.

## No More Class Operators

Core library type classes have been updated to use alphanumeric names for their members, instead of infix operators:

| Module Name          | Operator Name   | Function Name   |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `Prelude`            | `<$>`           | `map`           |
|                      | `<*>`           | `apply`         |
|                      | `>>=`           | `bind`          |
|                      | `<<<`           | `compose`       |
|                      | `<>`            | `append`        |
|                      | `+`             | `add`           |
|                      | `*`             | `mul`           |
|                      | `-`             | `sub`           |
|                      | `/`             | `div`           |
|                      | `==`            | `eq`            |
|                      | `&&`            | `conj`          |
|                      | `||`          | `disj`          |
| `Control.Alt`        | `<|>`          | `alt`           |
| `Control.Comonad`    | `<<=`           | `extend`        |
| `Data.Foreign.Index` | `!`             | `ix`            |

Old operators have been kept as aliases, so for the most part, code should not break, but you **do** have to update your type class instances.

Consult the documentation for the new class definitions.

Declaring operators in classes will now produce a warning.

## No more array sugar

`[]` syntax for array types has been removed. `[]` should now be written as `Array`, and `[a]` as `Array a`. It is still possible to use `[]` array literals, however:

```purescript
ints :: Array Int
ints = [1, 2, 3]
```

Cons patterns for arrays have been removed due to their bad performance. If you previously used cons patterns, consider using a fold (if possible), or using a `List` or `Seq` instead.

## No more inline FFI code

Foreign JavaScript imports have been moved out into separate `.js` files, and are no longer defined inline with `foreign import`. This is to enable the transition to multiple backends, by reducing our dependence on explicit Javascript.

Foreign modules are passed to the compiler with the `--ffi` flag.

Values should be provided in the form `exports.foo = ...`, similar to a CommonJS module.

Each foreign module file should have a comment `// module X.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` is the name of the module it is associated with.

An example can be found [here](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-eff/blob/v0.1.0-rc.1/src/Control/Monad/Eff.js).
